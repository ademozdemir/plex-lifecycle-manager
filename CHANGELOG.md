# Changelog

All notable changes to Plex Lifecycle Manager will be documented in this file.

## [2.1.1] - 2026-01-06 - CRITICAL BUG FIX

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL:** Config save was overwriting entire config instead of merging
  - Libraries section was deleted on every save
  - Rules section was deleted on every save
  - Caused "Error: 'libraries'" and "Error: 'rules'" during analysis
- **CRITICAL:** Web UI cleanup→rules mapping
  - Web form sends "cleanup" but config uses "rules"
  - Now properly mapped during save
  
### Added
- **Auto-detect libraries** from Plex after config save
  - Automatically populates libraries section
  - Detects library type (movie/show)
  - Smart rule assignment based on library name
- Deep merge for nested configuration sections
- Fallback defaults for missing critical sections
- Better error handling and logging in config save

### Changed
- save_config() now merges with existing config instead of overwriting
- Config save preserves all sections not in web form
- sort_keys=False in yaml.dump to maintain order

**UPGRADE URGENCY:** HIGH - All users should update immediately
